This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Ahoy!

## Here is a quick refresh / redesign of a dashboard

I published this app on netlify:

https://ui-test-example.netlify.app/

A few things:

- The charting library I used breaks when the screen shrinks
- I used styled-components for styling
- For design I used Framer to get started and then I jumped right into code in order to get a working prototype.
- If the side nav will collapse it will probably need icons.  I am not sure what each of the links are but I think if any are similar they should be groupd to help the user find what they need a little quicker.
